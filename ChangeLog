  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.2.2
  
  * Minor patch to remove deprecated Armadillo C++ macro which will allow
    RcppArmadillo to update to the latest version of armadillo. As a side
    effect, users of old compilers may see a compiler warning from 
    RcppArmadillo when building this package (this will only affect you if
    your compiler is too old to support R >= 4.0.0).

  * Updated Date Field in DESCRIPTION.

2018-06-11  Scott Ritchie <sritchie73@gmail.com>

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.2.0
  
  * Removed dependency on the ref package, which is being archived.
    The internal representation of the data, correlation, and network
    matrix for the dataset loaded into RAM has been changed from a 
    matrix (previously passed by reference between some functions 
    using the ref package) to an environment that contains a variable
    storing the matrix. By passing these environments between functions,
    the loaded dataset can be changed within an internal function 
    without the callee function creating a copy of the previously loaded
    dataset to be restored on the completion of the function call.
    
  * Enhanced code clarity by removing use of with(), which in many 
    instances made it unclear what scope variables were being
    operated on due to conflicts between process user input in an 
    environment variable and unprocessed user input in function arguments.
  
  * Added some minor optimisations to memory usage. The garbage collector
    is now called at the end of each user exported function. This ensures
    that any large matrices that have been loaded from disk are correctly
    unloaded, even when a function returns an error due to malformed 
    user input.
  
  * Reduced vignette file size by changing images from png to jpeg.

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.5
  
  * Bugfix to data heatmap and module summary bar charts: sample labels 
    previously appeared in reverse order (i.e. did not correspond to the 
    shown data). This has now been fixed.
    
  * Enhancement to data heatmap and module summary bar charts: Previously,
    when specifying 'orderSampleBy' only samples present in both the 
    plotted 'test' dataset and the 'orderSamplesBy' dataset were shown.
    Now, samples present in the the plotted 'test' dataset but not present
    in the 'orderSamplesBy' dataset are also shown on the data heatmap and
    module summary bar charts. These are shown below the samples present 
    in both dataset on both the data heatmap and module summary bar charts,
    separated from the samples present in both datasets by a horizontal
    black line. These samples appear ordered by their module summary values
    in the 'test' dataset.
    
  * R/plot-utils.R: plotProps() now returns an additional value indicating 
    the number of samples present in the 'test' dataset not present in the 
    'orderSamplesBy' dataset.
    
  * R/plot-functions.R: plotSquareHeatmap() and plotMultiBar() now have an
    additional argument, 'yLine', that tells both functions where to draw
    a horizontal black line (i.e. to indicate separation of samples present
    in both the 'orderSamplesBy' and 'test' dataset from those present only
    in the 'test' dataset).
    
  * R/plot-functions.R: plotMultiBar() now shows sample labels in the 
    correct order.
    
  * R/plot-module.R: plotModule() now keeps track of number of samples 
    present only in the 'test' dataset to pass to plotSquareHeatamp()
    and plotMultiBar().
    
  * R/plot-module.R: plotModule() now keeps track of number of samples 
    present only in the 'test' dataset to pass to plotSquareHeatamp()
    and plotMultiBar().
    
  * R/plot-topology.R plotData() and plotSummary() now keep track of 
    number of samples present in the 'test' dataset to pass to 
    plotSquareHeatmap() and plotMultiBar() respectively.

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.4
  
  * R/plot-functions.R: fixed bug in plotSquareHeatmap() that caused 'plotModule'
   and 'plotData' to crash when specifying 'orderSamplesBy' when not all samples 
   from the 'orderSamplesBy' dataset were present in the dataset to be rendered.
   Similarly, this fixes bugs in 'plotCorrelation' and 'plotNetwork' arising when
   setting 'symmetric=TRUE' when nodes from the discovery network were not present
   in the test dataset to be rendered.

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.3
  
  * Fixed bug in module data heatmap legends: the range of values present on 
    the legend is now restricted to the range of values present in the data 
    heatmap when the data contains both positive and negative values. Previously
    'plotModule' and 'plotData' would show legends for a range of values centered
    at 0.
    
  * Fixed bug in module data heatmap legends: the range of values shown now respects
    the values passed by the user in the 'dataRange' argument.
    
  * Fixed bug in gradient legends: the axis ticks at the lower or upper end of the
    range specified by the user now have add "<" and ">" to the labels to reflect
    values of that color may be outside the range shown.
    
  * R/plot-functions.R: 'addGradientLegend' now keeps separate track of the range 
    of values present in the data, the range of values to be shown on the legend, 
    and the range of values occupied by the color gradient used in the heatmap.
    
  * R/plot-functions.R: 'addGradientLegend' an axis tick will always be placed at 0
    on the legend if the range of values on the corresponding heatmap can be both 
    negative and positive.

  * R/plot-functions.R: extra argument add to 'plotSquareHeatmap' and 'plotTriangleHeatmap'
    to reflect separation of heatmap legend range from the range of values occupied by
    the color palette used in the heatmap. Calls to these functions from 'plotModule',
    'plotData', 'plotCorrelation', and 'plotNetwork' have been updated accordingly.
    
  * R/plot-module.R: added additional logic to 'plotModule' to separately determine the 
    range of values present in the data, those to be shown on the data heatmap legend, and 
    the range of values the heatmap palette occupies.
    
  * R/plot-topology.R: as above but for the 'plotData' function.

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.2
  
  * Clarified documentation for "backgroundLabel" argument used in many package
    functions to describe how to disable the behaviour.
    
2017-08-03  Scott Ritchie <sritchie73@gmail.com>

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.1
  
  * R/plot-module.R: Fixed bug where 'plotModule' would crash when attempting 
    to plot a single module where only 1 node was present in the test dataset 
    (e.g. where only 1 of the module's genes is expressed in the test cell-line).
    
  * R/plot-topology.R: Fixed same bug as above for 'plotCorrelation', 
   'plotNetwork', and 'plotData'
    
2017-07-03  Scott Ritchie <sritchie73@gmail.com>

  * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.1.0
  
  * R/modulePreservation.R: 'nPerm' argument may now be set to 0 to calculate
    the module preservation statistics across two datasets while skipping 
    the permutation test procedure.
  
  * src/permutations.cpp: reorganised code to return the observed test
    statistics without performing the permutation test procedure when the
    'nPerm' argument in modulePreservation() is set to 0.
    
  * src/permutationsNoData.cpp: reorganised code to return the observed test
    statistics without performing the permutation test procedure when the
    'nPerm' argument in modulePreservation() is set to 0.
    
  * man/modulePreservation.Rd: added description detailing the use case for
    'nPerm=0'.
    
  * man/*: minor changes in all man files due to generation with roxygen 6.0.1
    instead of roxygen 5.0.1.

2016-11-15  Scott Ritchie <sritchie73@gmail.com>

   * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.0.4
   
   * Restructured and curated documentation: Rd files are no longer generated
     for internal functions, and functions intended to extend basic package 
     usage have been removed from the package manual.

2016-10-20  Scott Ritchie <sritchie73@gmail.com>

   * DESCRIPTION: Release 1.0.3
   
   * README: updated to reflect publication in Cell Systems and package 
     publication on CRAN (as of version 1.0.2).

   * R/NetRep.R: fixed spelling mistake in package documentation.
   * man/NetRep.Rd: compilation of R/NetRep.R spelling fix.
   
   * R/check-user-input.R: in processInput() improved handling of user input 
     arugments 'modules', 'moduleAssignments', 'backgroundLabel' and 'test'
     to handle cases where user code has overwritten a necessary list element 
     with 'NULL'.
  
   * R/check-user-input.R: numeric labels in 'modules' are now returned as 
     "character", fixing a bug where the incorrect modules would be reported
     in the 'contigency' table list element returned by contigencyTable() in
     R/contingency.R

   * R/contingency.R: fixed bug where ratios returned in the 'propVarsExplained'
     list element by contingencyTable() were greater than 1 due to mismatch in
     in module order of the vectors when calculating the ratios (one ordered 
     as text, one numerically).
     
   * R/contingency.R: improved the 'contingency' table list element returned by 
     contigencyTable() so that it now reports module sizes in their discovery
     datasets, the number of nodes present in the other dataset in the 
     contigency table comparison, and includes modules with no nodes present in
     the other dataset.

   * R/networkProperties.R: in netPropsInternal() improved progress reporting
     messages so that the module discovery dataset is listed as well as the
     dataset in which the module properties are being calculated.

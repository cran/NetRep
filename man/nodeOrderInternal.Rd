\usage{
nodeOrderInternal(props, orderModules, simplify, verbose, na.rm, mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{props}{network properties to calculate order from.}

\item{orderModules}{logical; are we ordering the modules by similarity?}

\item{simplify}{logical; are we simplifying the output?}

\item{verbose}{logical; is verbose printing turned on?}

\item{na.rm}{logical; remove missing nodes?}

\item{mean}{logical; should the node order be calculated by averaging across
test datasets?}
}
\value{
list structure of ordered nodes.
